# Replay Steps for Puyopuyo Application Development

This document outlines the key steps and commands used to develop and document the Puyopuyo application, enabling reproducibility.

## Phase 1: Planning (Conceptual)

- **Objective**: Understand the requirements and create a development plan based on the documents in `docs/wiki/WIP/ぷよぷよ`.
- **Action**: Mentally formulated a plan to follow the iterations defined in `docs/requirement.md` and to develop using a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach.

## Phase 2: Application Setup

- **Objective**: Set up the application environment in the `app/` directory.
- **Action**: This phase was already completed in a previous session. The setup involved initializing a Node.js project, installing dependencies like Vite, Vitest, and TypeScript, and creating the basic file structure.

## Phase 3: Iterative Development

This phase involved implementing the game features iteration by iteration, following the TODOs in `docs/requirement.md`. Each iteration concluded with a commit.

- **Initial Check**:
  - `git log --oneline -n 10`: Checked the commit history to understand the current progress.

- **Iteration 5: Puyo Erasing**
  1.  `read_file`: Read `docs/requirement.md` to identify the tasks for Iteration 5.
  2.  `read_many_files`: Read `app/src/stage.ts` and its test file to understand the existing code.
  3.  `replace`: Added a new test case for `checkConnections` in `app/src/tests/stage.test.ts`.
  4.  `replace`: Implemented the `checkConnections` method in `app/src/stage.ts`.
  5.  `run_shell_command`: Ran `npm run test` in the `app` directory to verify the new method.
  6.  `replace`: Refactored the `checkErase` method to use `checkConnections`.
  7.  `run_shell_command`: Ran tests again to ensure the refactoring was successful.
  8.  `replace`: Updated `docs/requirement.md` with the completion status and a retrospective.
  9.  `run_shell_command`: Committed the changes with `git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement puyo erasing and refactor connection check"`.

- **Iteration 6: Chain Reactions**
  1.  `read_many_files`: Analyzed `app/src/score.ts` and `app/src/game.ts`.
  2.  Determined that the requirements for this iteration were already met by the existing implementation.
  3.  `replace`: Updated `docs/requirement.md`.
  4.  `run_shell_command`: Committed the documentation update.

- **Iteration 7: Zenkeshi Bonus**
  1.  Analyzed `app/src/game.ts` and `app/src/stage.ts`.
  2.  Determined that the requirements were already met.
  3.  `replace`: Updated `docs/requirement.md`.
  4.  `run_shell_command`: Committed the documentation update.

- **Iteration 8: Game Over**
  1.  Analyzed `app/src/game.ts` and `app/src/player.ts`.
  2.  `replace`: Added a restart functionality in `app/src/game.ts`.
  3.  `replace`: Updated `docs/requirement.md`.
  4.  `run_shell_command`: Committed the changes.

## Phase 4: Documentation

- **Objective**: Create documentation for the application.
- **Action**:
  1.  `glob`: Searched for journal files (which were not found).
  2.  `read_many_files`: Read all source code files in `app/src` to understand the overall architecture and implementation.
  3.  `write_file`: Created `docs/architecture.md` to document the application's architecture.
  4.  `write_file`: Created `docs/design.md` to document the design, focusing on the state machine.
  5.  `write_file`: Created `docs/implementation.md` to provide details on key implementations.
  6.  `read_file`: Read `mkdocs.yml`.
  7.  `replace`: Updated `mkdocs.yml` to include the new documentation files in the navigation.
  8.  `read_file`: Read `docs/index.md`.
  9.  `replace`: Updated `docs/index.md` to link to the new documentation.
  10. `write_file`: Created this `replay.md` file.
  11. `run_shell_command`: Committed all documentation changes.
